        <li><strong>Step 1: </strong> Mix flours and salt in a large bowl. Use a wooden spoon to stir in water and olive oil. Mix until a soft, elastic dough forms and add more water, if needed. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2: </strong> Divide dough into 10 equal portions, or less if you want larger chapatis. Roll each piece into a ball and let rest for a few minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3: </strong> Heat a lightly greased skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4: </strong> Use a rolling pin to roll dough balls out on a lightly floured surface until very thin, like a tortilla.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5: </strong> When the skillet starts to smoke, place a chapati in it. Cook until bottom has brown spots, about 30 seconds, then flip and cook 30 seconds more. Repeat to cook remaining chapatis.</li>
